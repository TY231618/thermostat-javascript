# thermostat-javascript

The challenge this week at Makers Academy was to build a interactive thermostat web app, in JavaScript. It whole process was test driven using Jasmine. I used jQuery to add interactive functionality and AJAX to make calls to external API's to find weather conditions from cities around the world.
