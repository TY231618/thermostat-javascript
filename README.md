# thermostat-javascript

The challenge this week at Makers Academy was to build a interactive thermostat web app, in JavaScript. It whole process was test driven using Jasmine. I used jQuery to add interactive functionality and AJAX to make calls to external API's to find weather conditions from cities around the world.

Installation
-------
1. Clone this repo $ git clone git@github.com:Wynndow/thermostat.git
2. Change directory into it $ cd thermostat

Usage
------
1. Open the app with $ open index.html
2. Control temperature and toggle power saving mode (limits max temp) with the buttons.
3. Use the text field to search for any city in the world and display it's weather.

Running tests
---------
* Tests are run and results displayed with $ open SpecRunner.html

Future Improvements
